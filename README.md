3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd ./chatBot_LSEG/

4. Install node dependencies:

   npx json-server --watch data/Chatbot-stockData.json --port 8000

# Additional Notes

   You may need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer to run this app.
   
   JSON Server is used to simulate a REST API and fetch data for the app. Make sure it's running alongside the development server.
   
   The development server automatically reloads the application in the browser when you save changes to the source files.
